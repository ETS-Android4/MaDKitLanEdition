	 * <pre>

	 * transmitted using a subclass of HookMessage depending on the nature of the
	 * event. That is, {@link OrganizationEvent}, {@link MessageEvent} or
	 * {@link AgentLifeEvent} messages will be sent by the kernel according to the
	 * type of the hook which has been requested.
	 * <p>
	 * To give up the hook, just send to the kernel another message built with the
	 * same action and it will remove the sender from the subscriber list.
	 * 
	 * @param hookType
	 *            the action event type to monitor
