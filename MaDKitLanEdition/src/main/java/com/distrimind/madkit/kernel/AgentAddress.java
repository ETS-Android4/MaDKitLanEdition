/**
 * Identifies an agent within the artificial society.
 * <p>
 * How this class works is very different from the previous versions of MaDKit.
 * More precisely, it now corresponds to a CGR location (community;group;role)
 * where the agent is in. So, an agent may have several AgentAddress as it could
 * join many CGR locations.
 * <p>
 * Moreover, if the related agent leaves the corresponding CGR location, then an
 * AgentAddress becomes invalid and no longer permits to reach this agent. For
 * instance, a message sent using
 * {@link AbstractAgent#sendMessage(AgentAddress, Message)} will not be
 * delivered if the agent has left the related CGR location.
