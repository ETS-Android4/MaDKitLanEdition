/**
 * This type of agent is between an AbstractAgent type and an Agent type. It is
 * designed for large scale systems. Large scale systems can't use a huge number
 * of Agent type, since each of them has a its own thread and since the
 * operating system can manage only a few limited number of threads (several
 * thousands). The solution could be to schedule AbstractAgent types, non
 * threaded, through a {@link Scheduler} agent. But here, the system works in
 * full CPU mode even if it has nothing to do. The solution produced here
 * consists of automatically scheduling AgentFakeThread agents types through
 * several threads with a limited number (the default maximum number of threads
 * is <code>Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()</code>.
 * 
 * To use the AgentFakeThread class, the user must inherit it, and overwrite the
 * method {@link #liveByStep(Message)}. This method is called for every received
 * message. If no message is received, the system does not consume CPU time. No
 * {@link #wait()} method must be called into this function. The AgentFakeThread
 * agents must be launched through the function
 * {@link AbstractAgent#launchAgent(AbstractAgent)} or equivalent. The threads
 * managing these agents are created progressively when AgentFakeThread are
 * launched. So, if no agent is launched, the system does not consume any
 * memory. If one agent is launched, only one thread is created, etc, until the
 * maximum number of threads is reached. The threads are destroyed also
 * progressively.
 * 
 * To change the priority of these threads, call the function
 * {@link #setThreadPriorityOfMaDKItServiceExecutor(int)} (int)}.
